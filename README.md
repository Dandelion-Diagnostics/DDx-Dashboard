# DDx-Dashboard
Repo to record the code used to produce dynamic plots and save them in a html file (dashboard)

Dashboard accessible through s3 bucket (only with an IP from BII):
`http://dandelion-dashboard.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/[dashboard_name.html]`

The html files are also stored in this repository.
    - `sams_ACP_DMSR_interactive.html` is an older version, with ACP and DMSR data
    - `sams_ACP_WELSH_interactive.html` is a more aesthetically pleasing version, but with ACP and Welsh data
    - `sams_ACP_WELSH_DMSR_interactive.html` has all data in the platinum layer (excluding disease mimics)
